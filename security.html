<p class="topic">Persistent and Session Cookies
</p>

<p>So, we’ve learned about the purposes of HTTP cookies, but did you know that there are also different types of HTTP cookies on the web? There are two different types go HTTP cookies called session cookies and persistent cookies.
</p>

<p class="subtopic">
  Session Cookies
</p>

<p>Session cookies play an important role when you're navigating through a website. These cookies are temporarily stored in your device’s random access memory (RAM) and are never saved to your hard drive. Because they exist only in RAM, session 
  cookies are designed to be short-lived, disappearing automatically once you close your browser or end your session. Their temporary nature makes them useful for keeping track of your activity during a single visit without leaving a lasting footprint on your device.<br><br>
  One of the key functions of session cookies is to enhance your browsing experience. For example, they help websites remember your actions across different pages, making features like the "back" button work smoothly. Without session cookies, 
  every time you moved to a new page, the website would lose track of your previous actions. These cookies are essential for maintaining continuity while you interact with a site, providing a seamless and more efficient user experience.
</p>

<p class="subtopic">
  Persistent Cookies
</p>

<p>
  Persistent cookies are a type of cookie that remains stored on a user's computer even after they close their web browser. 
  Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies are saved to the device’s hard drive and continue to exist until they either reach their expiration date or are manually deleted by the user. These cookies serve important 
  functions on the web, primarily helping websites recognize users when they return. By storing specific pieces of information over time, persistent cookies make it easier for users to have a smoother, more personalized experience without having to reset preferences or log in repeatedly.<br><br>
  One of the main uses of persistent cookies is authentication. They help websites remember if a user is logged in, under what account name, and sometimes even store login credentials to avoid the need for users to re-enter 
  passwords each visit. In addition to authentication, persistent cookies are used to track a user's visits and behavior across multiple sessions. E-commerce sites, for example, may monitor which products a user views in order to suggest similar or complementary items 
  later. By analyzing a user’s browsing history on their site, companies can offer personalized recommendations and create a more tailored shopping experience. Persistent cookies, therefore, play a crucial role in both user convenience and targeted content delivery.
</p>

<p class="topic">First and Third Party Cookies
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, the concept of cookies can be broken down even further into first and third party cookies.
   However some cookies could pose more of a potential threat than others. We will be discussing this concept further on this page!
</p>

<p class="subtopic">
  First Party Cookies
</p>

<p>
  First-party cookies are created and stored directly by the websites that users visit. They are typically considered safer than third-party cookies, especially when the site itself is reputable and secure. These cookies are often used to remember user preferences, keep users 
  logged in, and provide a more personalized browsing experience by tracking interactions that are only within that specific site. As long as a website has not been compromised by cyberattacks or data breaches, first-party cookies generally pose minimal risk to user privacy. They are an essential 
  part of making modern websites function smoothly and efficiently and they help users navigate sites a lot more easily without the need to re-enter information or reset settings every time they visit.
</p>

<p class="subtopic">
  Third Party Cookies
</p>

<p>
  Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are a little more concerning. These cookies aren't created by the site you're actually visiting, but by other companies (ad networks for example) that have content on that page. They allow advertisers and 
  analytics companies to track your browsing activity across different websites that have their ads. However, thanks to data protection laws, you often get the option to allow or block these cookies. Most of the time, 
  third-party cookies don't really affect your experience on a site, and many websites don’t rely on them to remember your preferences.
</p>

<p class="subtopic">
  Zombie Cookies
</p>

<p>
  There are also zombie cookies, which are a version of the third-party persistent cookies. These cookies are permanently installed on. User’s computer. Zombie cookies have the ability to 
  appear repeatedly even after they’ve been “removed” from your computer. These cookies are commonly used by web analytics companies, and they are used for the purpose of tracking an individual’s browsing habits. 
  Websites also use these cookies to ban users. These cookies are more dangerous because they can be created by hackers who will use zombie cookies to put viruses and malware on your computer.
</p>

<p class="subtopic">
  Essential Cookies
</p>

<p>
  Essential cookies are a type that’s more commonly known. These cookies play a role in the popups you get when visiting websites that may ask you for your cookie preferences. 
  They are a type of first party session cookies, and they are needed in order to run the website and services that you request online. An example of these cookies in action is that they have the ability to help remember your login information.

 Safe Browsing and Removing Cookies
</p>

<p>Not all cookies are dangerous, and safely navigating the web doesn’t have to be tedious. However, removing cookies can often lessen your risk 
  of being the victim of privacy breaches. However, doing this can also reset your browser tracking and personalization. Without cookies, 
  you may have to manually enter your preferences and information each time you visit a website.</p>

  

<p class="subtopic">
  Security Software Options
</p>

  <p>
  Oftentimes, removing cookies is a simple process. However, removing persistent tracking cookies and the malicious 
  types that are created by hackers isn’t always so simple. In order to keep your information protected and safe, it would be wise to invest 
  in a reputable premium protection software, and using a virtual private network (VPN) when you’re browsing the web.
